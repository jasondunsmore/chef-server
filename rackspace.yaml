  #### Getting Started
  Once the deployment is up, you can navigate to the of the server. If your DNS
  is not pointing to this installation, you can either access the deployment
  via IP, or add a line in your [hosts
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  to point your domain to the IP of this Cloud Server.

  The default password for your installation will show up on the right side of
  the login page. You'll be asked to reset the admin user password immediately
  after logging in.

  this page to help you skip to the sections that are most valuable to you.
